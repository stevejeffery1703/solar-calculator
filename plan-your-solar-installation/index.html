        <h2>Plan Your Solar Future</h2>
        <p><b>Navigating the financial landscape of domestic solar power isn’t easy.</b> There are many factors to consider: projected solar production, future electricity costs, payment options, interest rates, and more. The calculations can become so complex that many people simply give up.</p>
        <p>This is a mistake. Domestic solar power can make a lot of sense. Beyond the environmental benefits, it can deliver substantial long-term savings and increase your home’s value. <b>Walking away from solar could mean missing out on significant financial returns.</b></p>
        <p>Of course, no one wants to make a major investment hastily. Smart homeowners want the facts &mdash; only then can they decide whether solar power is right for their home.</p>
        <p>That’s where <b>SunWise</b> comes in. The <b>SunWise Solar Calculator</b> is a free, comprehensive, independent tool that helps you estimate the likely financial benefits of investing in solar power.</p>

        <h2>What's Special about SunWise?</h2>
         <p>Many solar calculators are fiddly and hard to use, 
         or give only limited information about the projected output of your system, 
         or demand your email address and phone number before giving you the data you're looking for.</p>
         <p><b>SunWise is different.</b> We know that solar power is a big investment, 
         and it's important to plan carefully in order to make a wise decision.
         We want you to have all the facts, without the hard sell or confidentiality concerns, 
         so that you can decide what's best for you.</p>
         <p>So we don't charge a fee, and we won't ask for your contact details. 
         We just give you the data with our simple, comprehensive calculator,
         and let you have all the time you need to think 
         about the best way forward for yourself and your home.</p>
         <p>When you're ready &mdash; <span class="italic">and not before</span> &mdash; 
         simply click on one of the links to our trusted suppliers, 
         and contact them to get a detailed survey and quotation.</p>

      <h2>How Does the SunWise Calculator Work?</h2>
      <p>At SunWise, we believe it's important for people to have all the facts before investing in solar power.
      We therefore want you to know how our model works, so that you can understand how we predict the savings you could make. 
      These details can seem a little technical, and you don't need to read them unless you want to, 
      but we'd like to give you the option anyway.</p>
      
      <ul>
      
       <li>
        <strong>System Capacity:</strong> Larger homes can fit more solar panels than smaller ones, and can therefore generate more power.
        A standard domestic solar panel measures ~39 x 66 inches, and generates around 0.4 kW. 
        An average sized home would be able to fit around 20 panels, though the details of course depend on the exact design of your roof.
        Adjust the settings on the SunWise Calculator to match the space available on your roof.
        Here's a rough rule of thumb:
         <ul>
          <li><b>Smaller homes: 3-5 kW</b> (6-13 panels)</li>
          <li><b>Medium homes: 6-8 kW</b> (15-20 panels)</li>
          <li><b>Larger homes: 9-12 kW</b> (22-30 panels)</li>
         </ul>
       </li>

       <li>
        <strong>Solar Panel Degradation:</strong> It's normal for solar panels to become slightly less efficient over time. 
        The SunWise calculator takes these effects into account, 
        assuming an average degradation of 0.5% per year over the life of the panels. 
        This allows you to make a conservative estimate of the likely savings.
       </li>


       <li>
        <strong>Efficiency:</strong> The efficiency of solar panels depends on many factors, 
        including the orientation and slope of the roof, and partial shade from surrounding trees or other structures.
        The SunWise calculator allows you to adjust the efficiency to estimate the impact of these factors.
        For a more accurate assessment of your particular property, please consult your chosen specialist installer.
       </li>
       
        <li>
        <strong>Geographical Location:</strong> The most significant contribution to your system's power output will be your geographical location.
        The SunWise calculator takes account of regional variations in solar intensity, using data obtained from the 
        <a href="https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a>.
        Simply select your state on the map or using the drop-down menu.
        Obviously there are regional variations within individual states &mdash; your chosen specialist installer will be able to give a more accurate estimate for your location.
